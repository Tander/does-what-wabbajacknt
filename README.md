# Does what Wabbajackn't

* How to install Wabbajack modpack without clicking download button for every mod?
* How to skip Slow Download while installing mods in Wabbajack?
* Is there a way to install FUS modpack automatically?

Yes! This simple script is made for automating installation of modpacks via [Wabbajack](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack). For people who, like me, won't deal with this noncense.

It's made for automating installation of [FUS modpack](https://github.com/Kvitekvist/FUS) for Skyrim VR, since it's very tedious to click through 500+ "Slow Download" buttons over 10 hours (due Nexus's speed limit) and there is no alternative presented by them. But probably will work on anything else in Wabbajack.

## Disclaimer
Be warned that such automations are probably against TOS of NexusMods and Wabbajack. Script published for educational purposes ONLY =3 

## Usage
**TL;DR:** Make sure Wabbajack's windows are auto-opening with button visible on screen (fullscreen should work). Install Python (>=3.10), run `pip install pyautogui`, run `main.py` and leave PC for night.
